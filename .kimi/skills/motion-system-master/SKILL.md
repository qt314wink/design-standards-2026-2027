# Motion System Master Skill

## Purpose

Use this skill to classify, design, audit, document, or implement motion systems across slides, editorial microsites, websites, and product UI. This skill is not limited to deck translation. It is a semantic motion framework for modern digital systems where expressive visual identity must coexist with stable interaction infrastructure.

This system is grounded in two ideas:
1. In an era of AI-generated polish, visible imperfection and controlled expressive variance can signal human presence, distinctiveness, and trust.
2. Chaos only works when the underlying system remains calm, readable, accessible, and rule-bound. Expressive surfaces must sit on top of invisible structural discipline.

## Operating model

Always classify motion in this order:
1. Determine whether the UI moment is structural, atmospheric, or interactive.
2. Determine the user's primary need: understanding / feeling / attention guidance.
3. Assign a primary motion role: Informational / Expressive / Focus.
4. Assign a tag type.
5. Assign a brand dialect: Organic / Structured / Hybrid.
6. Apply semantic tokens.
7. Apply accessibility and reduced-motion rules.
8. Apply performance constraints.
9. Generate implementation output.
10. Document rationale, fallback behavior, and QA expectations.

Never pick motion based only on visual taste.

## Motion roles

### Informational
Use when the user needs help understanding hierarchy, sequence, progression, state change, comparison, mechanism, or navigation structure. Should be clear, legible, calm, and restrained. Reveals one thing at a time.

### Expressive
Use when the goal is emotional framing, atmospheric tone, brand presence, editorial identity, or narrative impact. Strongest in hero moments, gallery surfaces, manifesto endings, and brand-led showcases. Must preserve readability and never destabilize functional interfaces.

### Focus
Use when the goal is to draw attention, confirm interaction, support affordance, highlight priority content, or clarify which object changed. Short, controlled, and tactical.

## Brand dialects

### Organic
- Feel: warm, fluid, embodied, tactile, breathable, soft, atmospheric
- Default easing: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1) for entrances; cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) for accents
- Duration bias: slightly longer, more spacious
- Best for: hero reveals, galleries, manifesto sections, soft card lift, atmospheric transitions

### Structured
- Feel: architectural, deliberate, controlled, mechanical, editorial, precise
- Default easing: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- Duration bias: slightly shorter, tighter
- Best for: tabs, diagrams, comparison modules, navigation, system states, technical reveals

### Hybrid
- Mix Organic and Structured per component purpose
- Rule: expressive surfaces can be Organic; structural UI should remain Structured

## Tag taxonomy

### Content/editorial tags
hero, thesis, comparison, process, technical, proof, manifesto, pause, cta, gallery, diagram, callout, bridge

### Website and app tags
nav, modal, drawer, form, feedback, state-change, list, detail, dashboard, media, loading, wayfinding, section-divider, background-atmosphere, tooltip, popover, accordion, tabs, carousel, card-grid, search, empty-state

## Tag definitions (key entries)

- hero: Expressive, Organic, xl 700ms, high density, fade-only reduced motion
- thesis: Informational+Expressive, Hybrid, lg 520ms, medium density
- comparison: Informational, Structured, sm 240ms, row-by-row reveal
- process: Informational, Structured, md 320ms, staged progression
- technical: Informational, Structured, md 320ms, diagram-led
- proof: Focus, Structured, sm 240ms, subtle emphasis only
- manifesto: Expressive, Organic, xl 700ms, emotional resolution
- pause: none, 0-180ms, near stillness
- cta: Focus, Organic accent, xs 180ms, affordance clarity
- gallery: Expressive, Organic, lg 520ms, gentle stagger
- diagram: Informational, Structured, md 320ms, one concept at a time
- callout: Focus, Organic accent, xxs 120ms, quick emphasis
- bridge: Informational, Hybrid, sm 240ms, soft handoff
- nav: Focus, Structured, xxs 120ms, low noise
- modal: Focus, Structured, md 320ms, clear entry
- drawer: Informational, Structured, md 320ms, directional
- form: Informational, Structured, xs 180ms, clarity first
- feedback: Focus, Organic accent, xs 180ms, fast and obvious
- state-change: Focus, Structured, xs 180ms
- dashboard: Informational, Structured, sm 240ms, low drama
- background-atmosphere: Expressive, Organic, xl 700ms, always optional

## Token architecture

### Duration scale
- motion-duration-xxs: 120ms (hover, focus, tooltip)
- motion-duration-xs: 180ms (button, affordance)
- motion-duration-sm: 240ms (card, row, small reveal)
- motion-duration-md: 320ms (section, modal, drawer)
- motion-duration-lg: 520ms (editorial, gallery, bridge)
- motion-duration-xl: 700ms (hero, manifesto, atmosphere)

### Easing tokens
- motion-ease-organic-enter: cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)
- motion-ease-organic-accent: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)
- motion-ease-structured-ui: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)

## Decision hierarchy

If content is dense, explanatory, or task-critical → default to quieter, informational motion.
If content is introductory, atmospheric, or manifest-like → expressive motion allowed.
If content changes state or requires interaction clarity → focus motion takes precedence.
If screen is mobile or low-power → simplify and shorten.
If prefers-reduced-motion is on → minimize to functional essentials only.

## Accessibility rules (mandatory)

- Support prefers-reduced-motion always
- Preserve content order and meaning when motion is removed
- Maintain text contrast and readability at all times
- Keep focus states visible
- Ensure keyboard accessibility throughout
- Avoid flashing and abrupt disruptive movement
- Never use motion as the only communication channel

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```

## Performance rules

- Prefer transform and opacity; avoid width/height/margin/padding animation
- Limit simultaneous animated focal points to 1 primary per beat
- Stagger secondary elements rather than animating all at once
- Keep SVG and WebGL strategic; no heavy looping in content areas
- Treat ambient motion as optional enhancement, not core infrastructure

## React/Next implementation rules

- Use semantic token references, not hardcoded values
- Support reduced-motion at component level
- Prefer transforms and opacity over layout-thrashing properties
- Keep interactive states short and obvious
- Avoid running large ambient animations near content-dense areas
- Route-level transitions only when they do not slow navigation
- Scroll-based reveals used sparingly and meaningfully

## Documentation pipeline

1. Define token JSON
2. Validate against schema
3. Generate CSS variables
4. Generate Tailwind mappings
5. Generate docs tables
6. Publish to repo or package
7. Test in component library or app

## Source-derived insight summary

From Beautiful Imperfection:
- Imperfection functions as honesty, tactility, and human signal
- Glitch, melt, blur, and psychedelic forms are expressive layers when controlled
- Chaos requires mathematical and accessible foundations

From The Death of Perfect:
- Polished sameness is losing distinction
- Slight inconsistency and human correction can restore presence
- The architecture must remain calm even when the surface becomes feral
